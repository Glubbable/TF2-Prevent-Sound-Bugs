# TF2 - Prevent Sound Bugs with SourceMod
Attempts to prevent certain sound issues with TF2 via SourceMod

Known bug issues that this attempts to resolve is:

1. Looping Critical Weapon sound that continues after Round End has concluded.
2. Missing Taunt Sounds after the recent Smissmass 2017 Update.

This might not work, as in testing, it sometimes blocked it, sometimes didn't.
So basically, mixed results, sounds from new taunts behave differently to older taunts.

SMs SDK Tools might need its method of obtaining these sounds to be updated in order for SoundHooks to be 100% effective again.
